 ## 1) Nuclei-Segementation 

#### Imagine speeding up research for almost every disease, from lung cancer and heart disease to rare disorders;automating nucleus detection, you could help unlock cures fasterâ€”from rare disorders to the common cold.trillion cells contain a nucleus full of DNA, the genetic code that programs each cell. 

#### Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work.


## Model used 
#### Unet
